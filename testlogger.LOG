2021-01-06 13:35:38.106] This is the long log....I am trying to close my laptop lid without anything happening to my 2nd
                         monitor.Lets say I've got streaming video up on my second monitor, all nice and full screen- and I
                         have email and other boring stuff on my primary, laptop screen. I'm done, want to kick back, and
                         enjoy the end of a movie, so I close the lid of my laptop- now everything moves onto the 2nd
                         external monitor as if it was the single primary monitor. I just want it to stay the same. As if I
                         had only turned one monitor off.
