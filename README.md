# Aveona: A Utility Library For Java
This is my custom coded Utility API for java. using advanced API coding techniques such as type parameters I have coded multiple classes that can be utilized to assist in other programs. If you would like to contribute please email me at jake.botka@gmail.com

## Highlights

### Base Package.
Complete this Highlight.

### IO Package.
Complete this Highlight.

### Security Package.

The security package allows programmers to interface with security functions at more ease that what openJDK by default uses. Additionaly ufnctions have been added on top that goes beyond just support exstention to OpenJDK. 

### Logger Package.

Contains both static and object orientaed ways to log data to multiple source such as files and/or to the console. The logger system contains classes that can log any object through type paramaters. Using the logger package api is exstremly easy. Please review the tests package.

### Systems Package.

The systems package include fully developed micosystems that programers can use. 
The systems include:

Auto Complete System API designed for both asyn and sync operation in providing results for string autocompletion. To       
implement is very easy. The special aspect of my auto complege engine and api is that programer can easily implement custom matching rules that includes a scoring system, priority system, identification system, and detailed results such as the indexes of all matching content as well as socring that allows more effective sorting of the results. Please review the tests package. AutoCompleteTests.java


### Time Package.

I added multiple classes to handle time based operations such as a stopwatch and a time convertor that can convert time value with ease. Please review the tests package.
